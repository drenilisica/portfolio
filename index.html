                    <p>I am Dreni Lisica ,I was born on June 4, 2002 in Prizren, a city located in the southwestern part of Kosovo.
                        As a child I displayed a strong interest in technology and the ways in which it could be used to solve
                        problems and improve people's lives. This interest led me to enroll in Loyola Gymnasium, where I received
                        a comprehensive education in a variety of subjects, including mathematics, science, and especially in computer science.<br><br>

                        After graduating from high school,I decided to continue my studies in the field of computer science by 
                        enrolling in the University of Business and Technology (UBT) in Prizren. During this time at UBT,I learned many things
                        in various programming languages, with a particular focus on web programming.I have a deep understanding
                        of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular in the Frontend, as well as JavaScript, Express, and Node Js in the backend.<br><br>

                        In addition to my technical skills,I am also well-versed in database management and I have a strong grasp of both 
                        MySQL and ORMs such as Sequelize and Prisma.</p>
